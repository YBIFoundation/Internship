TITLE:
            MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
Here's a mini project on a movie recommendation system using Python and the following libraries:

Libraries:

1. Pandas for data manipulation
2. NumPy for numerical computations
3. Scikit-learn for machine learning
4. Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization

Dataset:

We'll use the MovieLens dataset, which contains:

1. 100,000 ratings from 600 users on 9,000 movies
2. Movie genres, titles, and release years

Project Structure:

1. Data Preprocessing


import pandas as pd

# Load ratings and movies datasets
ratings = pd.read_csv('ratings.csv')
movies = pd.read_csv('movies.csv')

# Merge datasets on movie ID
data = pd.merge(ratings, movies, on='movieId')


2. Exploratory Data Analysis


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Visualize rating distribution
sns.histplot(data['rating'])
plt.show()

# Top 10 most rated movies
top_movies = data['movieId'].value_counts().head(10)
print(top_movies)


3. Recommendation Algorithm

We'll implement a simple collaborative filtering algorithm using Matrix Factorization.


from sklearn.decomposition import NMF

# Create user-item matrix
user_item_matrix = pd.pivot_table(data, values='rating', index='userId', columns='movieId')

# Apply Matrix Factorization
nmf = NMF(n_components=10)
user_features = nmf.fit_transform(user_item_matrix)
movie_features = nmf.components_.T


4. Recommendation Generation


def recommend_movies(user_id, num_recommendations):
    # Get user features
    user_feature = user_features[user_id]
    
    # Calculate similarities with all movies
    similarities = cosine_similarity(user_feature.reshape(1, -1), movie_features)
    
    # Get top N recommended movies
    recommended_movies = movies.iloc[similarities.argsort()[-num_recommendations:]]
    
    return recommended_movies

# Test recommendation
recommended_movies = recommend_movies(1, 5)
print(recommended_movies)


5. Evaluation


from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score

# Evaluate recommendation accuracy
precision = precision_score(data['rating'], recommended_movies['rating'])
recall = recall_score(data['rating'], recommended_movies['rating'])

print(f'Precision: {precision:.3f}, Recall: {recall:.3f}')


Example Use Cases:

1. User-based recommendations: Recommend movies to users based on their past ratings.
2. Movie-based recommendations: Recommend similar movies to users who liked a particular movie.
3. Hybrid recommendations: Combine user-based and movie-based recommendations.

Future Enhancements:

1. Incorporate additional data (e.g., genres, directors, actors)
2. Implement more advanced algorithms (e.g., Deep Learning, Graph-based methods)
3. Develop a web application for interactive recommendations

Here's the complete code for the movie recommendation system:


# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.decomposition import NMF
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load MovieLens dataset
ratings = pd.read_csv('ratings.csv')
movies = pd.read_csv('movies.csv')

# Merge datasets on movie ID
data = pd.merge(ratings, movies, on='movieId')

# Exploratory Data Analysis
sns.histplot(data['rating'])
plt.title('Rating Distribution')
plt.show()

# Top 10 most rated movies
top_movies = data['movieId'].value_counts().head(10)
print('Top 10 Most Rated Movies:')
print(top_movies)

# Create user-item matrix
user_item_matrix = pd.pivot_table(data, values='rating', index='userId', columns='movieId')

# Apply Matrix Factorization
nmf = NMF(n_components=10)
user_features = nmf.fit_transform(user_item_matrix)
movie_features = nmf.components_.T

# Recommendation function
def recommend_movies(user_id, num_recommendations):
    # Get user features
    user_feature = user_features[user_id]
    
    # Calculate similarities with all movies
    similarities = cosine_similarity(user_feature.reshape(1, -1), movie_features)
    
    # Get top N recommended movies
    recommended_movies = movies.iloc[similarities.argsort()[-num_recommendations:]]
    
    return recommended_movies

# Test recommendation
recommended_movies = recommend_movies(1, 5)
print('Recommended Movies for User 1:')
print(recommended_movies)

# Evaluate recommendation accuracy
precision = precision_score(data['rating'], recommended_movies['rating'])
recall = recall_score(data['rating'], recommended_movies['rating'])

print(f'Precision: {precision:.3f}, Recall: {recall:.3f}')

Note:

- This code uses the ml-latest-small dataset, which contains 100,000 ratings.
- For larger datasets, consider using more advanced techniques or optimized libraries.

Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Future Enhancements:

1. Incorporate additional data (e.g., genres, directors, actors)
2. Implement more advanced algorithms (e.g., Deep Learning, Graph-based methods)
3. Develop a web application for interactive recommendations
